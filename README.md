# Video Streaming Rover Project

# Project Overview

This repository documents the development of a video streaming rover created as part of my college project. The rover is designed for real-time video streaming, efficient movement control, and advanced human face detection using machine learning algorithms. It integrates multiple components for seamless operation and data management.

# Key Features

# Power Supply : 

Double A Battery with Battery Case: The rover is powered by double A batteries housed in a compact battery case, ensuring a lightweight and efficient power supply suitable for its small size.

# Control System : 

Dual Arduino UNO Setup:

Arduino UNO (Transmitter): Connected to the power circuit board, it acts as a transmitter, sending movement radio signals.

Arduino UNO (Receiver): Receives movement signals from the transmitter to control the roverâ€™s movement effectively.

# Video Streaming :

Raspberry Pi: Facilitates real-time video streaming functionality.

USB B 1080p Webcam: Captures high-definition video, which is streamed to an online cloud computing platform for storage and further analysis.

# Machine Learning Integration

Human Face Detection Algorithm:

Detects and raises an alert if a human is encountered in the rover's path.

Captures multiple images of the detected person and stores them in the cloud for analysis and record-keeping.

# Technical Highlights :

Integration of hardware and software components for smooth operation.

Real-time video streaming and storage on a cloud platform.

Advanced machine learning algorithms for human face detection and alert generation.

# Learnings and Future Scope :

The project provided hands-on experience with embedded systems, video streaming technology, and machine learning.

# Future enhancements could include:

Improved battery life for extended operation.

Enhanced video resolution and streaming quality.

Additional AI functionalities such as object recognition and autonomous navigation.
